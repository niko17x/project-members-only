Implement message for users. Each message should be stored in database with user data like username and user ID.

Non-members can only view the message only - no additional details.
  Homescreen shows visitor the option to sign in, register or just view messages.
  Visitor can click 'view messages' and is then taken to message screen.
  Message screen has the option for the user to join club or sign in.
    If user wants to join, they are redirected to the main home screen to register.

Implementing special membership status:
  User can enter passcode when signed in with their account.
  Add a link on main page for user to enter passcode.
  Create a page user can go to for entering in passcode.
  Upon successful validation of passcode, user is in `exclusive status` and gets membership perks.

Membership perks:
  Members can see the author and date of each message.

Admins:
  Admin Screen for admin functions.
  A user can register as an admin.
  Admin status grants user to delete or modify any message.
  Revoke member status of profiles.

USERS CAN BE:
  1. Not authenticated.
    - Only view message itself only.
  2. Authenticated but not a member.
    - View message & create new messages & delete message.
  3. Authenticated & a member.
    - View message with details & create new messages & delete message.

DELETING MESSAGES:
  1. User must be authenticated.
    - Authenticated users can view delete button on their own messages.
  2. User clicking on delete button removes message from mongo db.

TODO:
  1. Create a page for Admin functionality.
    - Deleting users.
  2. Create a page where users can become a member.
    - User must be already authenticated to visit page.
    - Add a simple question that grants member status to currently authenticated user.
      - Upon success, current authenticated user becomes member status by default.
